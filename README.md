# Simple-Machine-Learning-Project
I created this simple machine learning model which covers several machine learning topics such as linear regression, accuracy of the model, and prediction of students' grade. I first used pandas to read the .csv file, after that, I used numpy to create two different arrays to test, train module on 10% of the data then applied linear regression to calculate grade and the accuracy of the model.
